blues55:

allows to use your Siemens S55 (and maybe similar phones) to remote
control your pc. It has been greatly inspired by bluemote which
only works for Sony Ericssons.

Compilation:
  usually just 'scons' should do the trick. You obviously need 'scons'
  installed (http://www.scons.org).

Usage:
  blues55 will read every pressed key on your phone. These keys aren't
  intercepted, and will hence be interpreted by your phone. It's
  therefore best to go into the keylock-state of your phone. Avoid to
  press 112 or 911 inadvertely though, as these numbers work even in
  keylocked-state.

  run ./blues55 without any parameter to see the options.

Examples:
  // bind the /dev/rfcomm0 to your cell-phone (use 'hcitool scan' to get
  // the adress of your phone)
  sudo rfcomm bind 0 00:11:22:33:44:55

  // get into the keylock-state of your phone.
  // then run blues55 to control the keyboard (-k):
  ./blues55 -k
